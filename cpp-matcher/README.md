# CPP Matcher

## Overview

CPP Matcher is an *in-progress* automated conversation partner matching system built for my club. It processes applicant data from a CSV file and pairs participants based on language compatibility and shared availability.

## Context 📖

Originally, when I was the Vice President of the Conversation Partners Program, I handled the matching process manually. Sorting through applications, comparing languages, and cross-checking availability took approximately two full days to complete.

As the number of applicants continued to grow, this manual process became inefficient and difficult to scale. CPP Matcher was created to automate that workflow. While still in progress, the goal is to reduce the entire matching process to roughly 10 minutes through structured data parsing and rule-based pairing logic.

This project represents a shift from manual administrative work to scalable automation.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript / Algorithmic matching logic
- PapaParse Library (CSV data parsing) 

## Goal 🎯

To create a reliable, scalable matching system that eliminates manual sorting, reduces human error, and allows future Vice Presidents to focus on more important responsibilities.
